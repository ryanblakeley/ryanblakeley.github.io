          <li>If ordering prepared foods for the refrigerator, will you provide storage containers, or would you like me to provide single-use containers (aluminum, paper, and plastic)? I can recommend restaurant-quality options (stainless steel, glass, ceramic) if you're interested.</li>
          <li>Are you ok with me using your kitchen equipment like bowls, tools, etc.? If not, I will bring more stuff and it's no problem.</li>
